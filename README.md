## Barduino UI
 (WIP! NOT READY FOR USE)

The "Barduino" is a machine that the EECS section of HTMAA made in 2024. It is an automated bartending robot that dispenses liquids into cups on a turntable. Truly a marvel of MIT studentsâ€™ ingenuity and love of alcohol.

## HOW TO USE
If you are using a Windows machine, download the .exe in the dist folder and run it as usual. If you are using mac or windows clone the repo and rebuild for your operating system.
